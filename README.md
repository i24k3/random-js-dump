### [createArray.js](./createArray.js)
A simple custom array-like object implementation. Supports basic methods like:
- `push(item)` — adds an item to the end.
- `pop()` — removes and returns the last item.
- `filter(callback)` — filters the data based on the provided callback.
It works with both arrays and plain objects and tries to mimic native array behavior in a minimal way.
